# intro-data-capstone-biodiversity

This is the capstone project for the Codecademy Data Analysis Certificate Program. The data sets were provided by codecademy.
I completed this project using Jupyter Notebooks. The code is the .py file and I included a slideshow pdf to summarize my findings.

My next step to increase my data analysis knowledge it to find open-sourced data and explore, clean, and analyze the new dataset.
